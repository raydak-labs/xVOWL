Welcome to xVOWL, the cutting-edge solution for ontology generation, visualization, and editing. Built on the foundations of established tools like WebVOWL and Protégé, xVOWL takes ontology management to the next level with advanced features and improved performance.

We have the idea of improving the existing solutions in regards to visualizations, exploration and working with OWL. We have many ideas which include providing state of the art visualization, full-features editors, sharable workplaces, AI infused workflows and much more.

Before we start tackling this we want to see if we have enough interest and even maybe some possible investors or funders (like universities or companies) who would like to support and provide their influence into the products.
